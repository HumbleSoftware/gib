Gib - A Build Tool
==================

Gib is a build tool for static assets inspired by NGBP, Brunch and Grunt.
Built on top of gulp, Gib is declaratively configured, favors convention and
is extensible.  It may be used in an existing gulp file and gulp tasks may be
created directly in a gibberish file.

# Examples

Gib builds NGBP.  Copy `examples/ngbp-gibberish.js` to `ngbp/gibberish.js` 
and run `gib`.
